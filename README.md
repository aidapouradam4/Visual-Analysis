To tackle this issue, the author employs various information visualization techniques (InfoVis) for childhood data, focusing on widely used methods such as Bar Charts and Maps. The data utilized is sourced from the Victorian Government and the Australian Taxation Office, spanning the years 2009 to 2021. The analysis categorizes and examines data based on crime rates, income levels, educational providers, age, salary, and job opportunities in different suburbs.
